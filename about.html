              </h1>
              <p class="description">
                My name is Aiden Burgess and I am a recent graduate from the University of Iowa. 
                After taking some database and visualization courses in school, I learned I have a real love for data. 
                I graduated with a bachelors degree in computer science and am now looking for employment in data related fields. 
              </p>
              <p class="description">
                Outside of the classroom or professional spaces I enjoy being outdoors doing things like hiking and playing golf. 
                Something that I have always loved to do in my free time is paint. This is another way, along with coding, that I can stay creative. Lastly, I love being with friends and family,
                whether its at home, or out doing something fun. 
              </p>
